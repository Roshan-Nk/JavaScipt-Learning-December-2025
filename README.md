# JavaScipt Learning December 2025
 This contains my web dev project and progress for the month of december


This is my first proper js project and i wanted to test my knowledge by building an API based weather site.
Problem #1 i faced was that the API i decided to use (open-meteo) for getting weather needed Latitude and Longitude of selected location in its fetch url. (Almost all weather forecast API needed it).

So i found another API (geoapify) that takes in user location and returns many information including Latitude and Longitude that we can then use the our main API fetch.

First i started by creating basic Ui layout to get idea of what info i want to display and how it should appear on desktop vs mobile.

Day 2 

I fixed the site to show date, day and time. I also made the changes to show next 6 hour temperature with time. I learned about Date object, and using "?" as a concise if/else statement. 

I am pretty confident about using API and with basic javascript so far. Though i just learned that showing API key directly within website code isnt the best practice as that can be abused, so i will have to learn how to go about that.
